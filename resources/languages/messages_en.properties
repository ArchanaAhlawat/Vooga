PlayerHeading = Playing Created Games
PlayerBody = Once you finish building and subsequently saving your game, you can go ahead and play it! \
			To play the game that was created, simply select 'Play' in the main menu, and choose which game to play. \
			If you previously made progress that you saved in the selected game, you will also have the option to continue from where you left off. \
			Otherwise, there is the option to start the game from the beginning, which is "New Game."

FAQBody = Q: Can I create games other than RPGs? \n\
		A: Fortunately, VOOGA was built with a great deal of flexibility. \
		Although the primarily purpose of VOOGA was for RPGs, we currently support platformer games, \
		and our functionality extends itself quite well to other genres such as puzzle games.
